Hello! I'm Guilherme and I'm working on a test automation project of a opensource web site called OrangeHRM (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) with the use of Cypress.

To acess the project you must have:

1) Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en)
2) Cypress installed (https://www.cypress.io)

Then, follow the cypress instructions to get to the automatic testing (you can run it using npx cypress open in the terminal). You may add the OrangeHRM in the Trust list of your Anti-Virus.

I'll do it encrementally adding new tests every couple of days. The OrangeHRM system seems to be quite large, so it would be a lot of work. 

The test scripts are writen in the testcrips.txt file and the automatic scripts are in the e2e file within the login.cy.js
